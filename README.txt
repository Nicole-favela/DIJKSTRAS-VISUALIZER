DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM VISUALIZER:

Path-finding visualizer using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (a greedy algorithm). Click to define a start and end then draw the barrier (as convoluted as you want) and press the space bar to begin. Watch visited nodes expand outward while listening to ac/dc in the background (or the mp3 of your choice). Press command + c (or central + c on windows) to start over and clear the game.
